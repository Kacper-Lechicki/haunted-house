# 📁 **Name**: haunted_house

### 🎯 **Goal**: 
The aim of this project is for me to create a haunted house scene using Three.js, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with different lighting setups and shadow effects. Through experimentation with various techniques, I'll explore the capabilities of Three.js and develop my skills in crafting immersive 3D environments. This project presents an opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of 3D rendering and enhance my ability to evoke specific atmospheres and moods within virtual scenes.

### 🛠️ **Tools**:
Three.js, Javascript
